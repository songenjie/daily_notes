## Project Experience

### Project 1: OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

OLAP solves Pb level data storage, ad hoc query, efficient and accurate de duplication, multiple data source access, compatibility with multiple data types, monitoring MySQL protocol, column storage, high availability and high concurrency fact data analysis system platform. Currently, Doris and Clickhouse are two open source products, with Doris as the primary work and Clickhouse as the main work in the later stage



#### 1 Apache Doris :  https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris

Doris mainly integrates the technology of Google Mesa and Apache Impala, and it is based on a column-oriented storage engine and can communicate by MySQL client.
