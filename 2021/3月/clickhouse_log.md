<Information> Application: It looks like this system does not have procfs mounted at /proc location, neither clickhouse-server process has CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. 'taskstats' performance statistics will be disabled. It could happen due to incorrect ClickHouse package installation. You can try to resolve the problem manually with 'sudo setcap cap_net_admin=+ep /data0/jdolap/clickhouse/lib/clickhouse'. Note that it will not work on 'nosuid' mounted filesystems. It also doesn't work if you run clickhouse-server inside network namespace as it happens in some containers.
